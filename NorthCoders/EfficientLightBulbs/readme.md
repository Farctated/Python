Jim plans to buy new pack of assorted light bulbs.

He has heard that light bulbs are the most efficient when their serial number

is an odd number
has exactly six digits
He would appreciate you writing some code that figured out which serial numbers met the criteria.

When this function runs, it will receive an array of serialNumbers - something like

[32438, 34193, 149143, 4329429, 98537, 238791, 23492, 298342]
You need to add code that will ensure Jim collects the serial numbers he wants to keep in the provided variable, efficientSerialNumbers.

For the above array, this would mean that efficientSerialNumbers should end up containing

[149143, 238791]
We've added a log of serial numbers so you can see in the console what numbers are in the array when we try out your function. You are welcome to remove it, change it, do whatever you find useful!
